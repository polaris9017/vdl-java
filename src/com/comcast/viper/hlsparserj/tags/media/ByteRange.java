/**
 * <pre>
 * Represents a byte range stream tag.
 *
 * The EXT-X-BYTERANGE tag indicates that a media segment is a sub-range
 * of the resource identified by its media URI.  It applies only to the
 * next media URI that follows it in the Playlist.  Its format is:
 *
 *   #EXT-X-BYTERANGE:&lt;n&gt;[@&lt;o&gt;]
 *
 * where n is a decimal-integer indicating the length of the sub-range
 * in bytes.  If present, o is a decimal-integer indicating the start of
 * the sub-range, as a byte offset from the beginning of the resource.
 * If o is not present, the sub-range begins at the next byte following
 * the sub-range of the previous media segment.
 *
 * If o is not present, a previous media segment MUST appear in the
 * Playlist file and MUST be a sub-range of the same media resource.
 *
 * A media URI with no EXT-X-BYTERANGE tag applied to it specifies a
 * media segment that consists of the entire resource.
 *
 * The EXT-X-BYTERANGE tag appeared in version 4 of the protocol.  It
 * MUST NOT appear in a Master Playlist.
 * </pre>
